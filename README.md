## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

Longer than I had expected, although total time spent on creating (more specifically perfecting) the assignment took several hours with aid of others

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The final outcome of the assignment

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The creation of the assignment not as how I thought it to be, was unable to do so due to lack of knowledge and planning

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The understanding of how the program is to be run

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Spend more time on it and being prepared

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
Looking back at past exercises/lectures and some internet assistance. Most importantly the aid of my friends whom I would not be able to have completed this at all if not for them.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Creation and finalisation of the classes and GUI. Aid from friends (showing me how it should become) and some internet help on errors encountered.
